# My DSA Final Project

## Project Overview:
A Capstone Project completed as part of a three-month intensive Data Analysis program, aimed at generating insights to address key questions in the field of Human Resource Analytics in Palmora Group. This part of the project uses Power BI visualization skills to answer the stated questions.

The overarching aim of this project is to identify any instances of gender inequality within Palmora Group and to present actionable recommendations to support informed management decision-making.

### Insight:
- Kaduna and Abuja have a higher total number of employees relative to Lagos.
- In every region, males outnumber females, indicative of gender disparity that is consistent across geographic locations.

### Insight:
- Departments like Marketing, Training, Engineering, Business Development, and Human Resources show comparatively better gender balance. While departments such as Accounting, Sales, Support, Project Management, and Legal appear to be dominated by male.
- The presence of undisclosed gender entries in most departments should be highlighted to improve data completeness and better support HR policy evaluation.

### Analysis:
- Gender imbalance exists both regionally and across departments in Palmora Group.
- Technical and strategic departments (e.g. Project Management, Legal, and Sales) are notably male-heavy, suggesting potential constraints to female participation or promotion.
- There is no region or department with female majority, hinting at a systemic issue rather than isolated cases.

### Insight:
- Among all available options (e.g., Poor, Average, Good, Very Good, Very Poor and Not Rated), "Average" and "Good" received the highest number of responses. This implies that most respondents do not feel strongly one way or the other about gender equality in Palmora Group.
- In addition, a notable portion of these "Average" ratings came from male respondents.

### Analysis:
 - Targeted communication or training of employees may be required to raise awareness and improve perceptions.

### EDA:
3. Analyse the companyâ€™s salary structure, and identify any instance of a gender pay gap (Average Male Salary minus Average Female Salary). Once gender pay gap is established, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management.

### Insight:
- The gender pay gap appears much more noticeable in the Services, Human Resources, and Marketing departments.
- Within these departments, the regions of Abuja and Kaduna seem to contribute most significantly to this disparity, as the male average salaries in these regions within these departments are on average considerably higher than those for females.
